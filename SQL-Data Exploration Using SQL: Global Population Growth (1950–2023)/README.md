# 🌍 Data Exploration Using SQL: Global Population Growth (1950–2023)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global population growth from 1950 to 2023 using SQL.  
The goal is to explore long-term trends, understand regional population dynamics, and identify growth patterns using industry-standard SQL techniques.

The dataset contains historical population figures for major world regions and countries, sourced from Kaggle.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft SQL Server** – Query execution & analysis  
- **SQL** – Joins, aggregations, filtering, CTEs, and window functions  
- **Kaggle Dataset** – “World Population Data”  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- 🌐 **Global population increased from ~2.5B (1950) to over 8B in 2023**, showing sustained exponential growth.  
- 🌏 **Asia contributed over 60%** of the global population increase between 1950–2023.  
- 🌍 **Africa recorded the fastest growth rate**, averaging **3%+ annually**, driven by high birth rates.  
- 🇪🇺 Europe’s growth slowed significantly after the 1990s, with several countries showing population decline.  
- 🌎 North and South America showed stable but moderate growth across the decades.

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Demonstrated
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for clean, readable queries  
- **Aggregations** (SUM, AVG, COUNT) for trend analysis  
- **GROUP BY** for regional comparisons  
- **Window Functions** (ROW_NUMBER, LAG, LEAD) for time-series analytics  
- **Joins** to merge multiple population tables  
- **Ordering & Filtering** to extract meaningful subsets of data  

---

## 🧪 Example Analyses Performed
- Total population by continent (1950–2023)  
- Year-over-year population growth  
- Ranking countries by growth rate  
- Identifying the top 10 fastest-growing countries  
- Finding regions with declining or stagnant population

## 🚀 How to Run This Project
1. Clone the repository  
2. Import the dataset into SQL Server  
3. Open `population_queries.sql`  
4. Execute queries block-by-block  
5. Modify or extend analysis as needed
