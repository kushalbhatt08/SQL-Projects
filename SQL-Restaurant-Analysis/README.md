# Project Overview

This project performs exploratory and ad-hoc SQL analysis on restaurant datasets using two primary tables: `menu_items` and `order_details2`. The objective is to extract meaningful business insights related to item popularity, customer purchasing behavior, and overall sales trends through structured SQL queries.

# Introduction

The purpose of this analysis is to apply SQL techniques to real-world restaurant data. By constructing and executing analytical queries, the project identifies patterns in customer preferences, evaluates menu performance, and measures operational outcomes.

The results of this analysis can support informed decision-making, such as refining menu offerings, improving pricing strategies, and enhancing overall business performance through data-driven insights.

# Data Preparation

## Database Initialization

The first step involves loading the `menu_items` and `order_details2` CSV files into a relational database management system. This process establishes a structured dataset that can be efficiently queried using SQL.

## Database Structure and Schema

Once the data is imported, the database consists of related tables that represent:

- The list of available menu items  
- Detailed transaction records of customer orders  

These tables are structured to reflect actual restaurant operations, enabling meaningful relational analysis through joins and aggregations.

## Data Relationships and Integrity

To maintain consistency and reliability, primary and foreign key constraints are defined within the database. These relationships ensure:

- Accurate linking between menu items and order records  
- Prevention of duplicate or inconsistent data  
- Reliable results when executing complex SQL queries  

This structured setup allows for deeper analytical exploration and ensures trustworthy outputs throughout the project.
